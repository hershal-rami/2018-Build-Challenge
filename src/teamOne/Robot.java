/**
 * This is the Robot class, essentially the "main hub" of the project.
 * 
 * If the organization/path the code follows is confusing, here's a quick
 * rundown: -robotInit() is ran when the robot is turned on
 * 
 * -When autonomous is enabled from the DriverStation, the code runs
 * autonomousInit()
 * 
 * -autonomousInit() instantiates the Wheel objects.
 *
 * -This takes the code to the Wheel constructor(s) which make the Sparks and
 * run startWheel()
 * 
 * -startWheel() creates the wheelThread and starts it
 * 
 * -The code goes to run(), which continues to loop and set the Sparks according
 * to the code
 * 
 * -Once autonomous is disabled, the code runs disabledInit() which calls
 * wheel.stop()
 * 
 * -wheel.stop() sets the Sparks to 0 speed and stops the motor(s)
 *
