	 * These Latches are defined as Objects in the bottom of this java file. Since

	 * simply add another class in this same file for that object. Remember, a class
	 * and a java file are not the same thing. One file can have multiple classes.
	 * For convenience, it may make more sense to imagine that the Latch class is in
	 * it's own file, similar to how we coded objects during training.
	 * 
	 * Additionally, these lines create ARRAYS of Latches, not just a Latch object.
	 * Think of an array as a group of multiple data types. While generally used
	 * with primitives such as ints or doubles, they can also be used with objects
	 * as seen here. When created without defining any values, all values in the
	 * array are 0, empty, or null depending on the data type.
	 * 
	 * We know that these are arrays because they contain [] in the object
	 * declaration. Normally, an object is defined as Object myObject = new
	 * Object(); However, when making an array of objects, it is defined as Objecy
	 * myObject[] = new Object[SIZE];

		 * The keyword super is brand new to us! Let's talk a bit about what it means
		 * and what it does. To understand the "super" keyword, we must first talk about
		 * inheritance. Inheritance is the concept that one Object class may "inherit"
		 * features (such as fields, methods, even variables) from a "parent" class.
		 * This is normally done so that one class may build on another without adding
		 * unneccessary features to the original.
		 * 
		 * For example, a class which defines a Bike object may construct an object
		 * based on the bike's gear and speed, and possess methods to speed up or slow
		 * down. If I wanted to now make a MountainBike object, I COULD rewrite all of
		 * the code I wrote for the Bike object, OR I can have MountainBike inherit
		 * those features from the Bike object. Then, in my MountainBike class I can add
		 * a method to set my seat height; a method that is unique to my MountainBike
		 * class. Since Mountain Bikes are still Bikes, they possess all features of
		 * Bikes, however they also contain their own features unique to MountainBikes.
		 * For another example, I coud have a Vehicle class be the parent class, and
		 * then have a Truck class inherit features from the Vehicle class. All Trucks
		 * are Vehicles, and all MountainBikes are Bikes, but not vice versa.
		 * 
		 * To actually inherit methods, you simply need to use the "extends" keyword in
		 * the header for the class (Scroll up if you're unsure what I mean). Please
		 * note that this is a DIFFERENT keyword than "implements." We will discuss the
		 * specific differences between the two once we discuss interfaces, but for now
		 * just remember that "extends" is for inheritance.
		 * 
		 * Now that the XboxController class extends "Joystick" (which is a pre-written
		 * class that comes in our FRC plugins) we can add our own methods onto it
		 * (which are unique to XboxController) so that it can better suit our needs. We
		 * still get the benefits of the Joystick class, but we can add onto it. Instead
		 * of rewriting the constructor, we can just re-use the Joystick constructor by
		 * calling "super(port)" which takes a parameter port and uses the Joystick
		 * constructor to create our XboxController object.
		 * 
		 * Type "super." in eclipse and take a look at all the different methods we have
		 * access to through the Joystick class! Want to read the Joystick class code?
		 * Click on Joystick up at the top and press F3.
